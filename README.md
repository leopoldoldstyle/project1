Assembling the game in pieces

This is where we will be placing critical pieces of our code. Please thoroughly label each section of your code as to where it will be placed, what it will be doing, and any other simple key parts of its changes. We will be using GameMaker so check all commit changes before you began working on your code and make those changes appropriately. This will save you a ton of time in the long run.
